### How-to
1. Generate your own API Key from Clockify (In Clockify page on the top right, Profile > Preferences > Advance > Manage API Keys > Generate)
2. Grab your workspace ID (In Clockify page on the top left, select the three dots by your workspace name > Workspace Settings > Grab the ID from the URL)
3. Grab your User ID by using the 'Grab User ID' button
4. Done, make sure to refresh the client or project list.

Note:
- Stopping the timer manually through the Clockify page will not stop the timer in Blender. If so, you can reset the timer by simply using on the 'Stop Timer Button'.
